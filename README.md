This are two assignments for HKU-FITE7410.

# Assignment 1

## 1.	(25%) Exploratory Data Analysis
a.	Download the following dataset Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection from the link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1
b.	Using the R package, conduct exploratory analysis of the dataset downloaded

## 2.	(25%) Cluster Analysis
a.	Download the following dataset Credit Card Fraud Detection Data from the link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
b.	Using the R package, conduct cluster analysis of the dataset downloaded

NOTE: A sample R script is provided, but you still need to complete the program. Or you can build the model by yourselves and use whatever library you like.
 
## 3.	(50%) Write a 2-3 pages essay on the following:
a.	Describe the dataset based on the exploratory analysis result, including:
•	Summary description of the dataset
•	Univariate analysis
•	Bi-/Multi-variate analysis
•	Missing data/Outlier analysis
b.	Describe the following based on the k-means clustering results, including:
•	Explain how you find the optimal number “k”, i.e. number of clusters used to build the k-means model
•	Name the clusters found and interpret what each cluster represents

## 4.	Submission on Moodle:
a.	R language script
b.	A pdf version report


# Assignment 2

## 1.	Any TWO Supervised Learning Algorithms
a.	Download the following dataset Auto Insurance Claims Data from the link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/buntyshah/auto-insurance-claims-data
b.	Using the R package, develop two fraud detection models with any TWO supervised learning algorithms. 
c.	You can refer to the provided R program of a fraud detection model using TWO sample supervised learning algorithms

## 2.	Write an essay of not more than 2 pages on the following:
Based on the results of your fraud detection models developed in (1) above:
a.	Describe the performances of the 2 fraud detection models based on the results; and 
b.	Explain which one is more suitable for this case and why from a practical perspective by citing examples.

## 3.	Submission on Moodle:
a.	R language script
b.	A pdf version report
